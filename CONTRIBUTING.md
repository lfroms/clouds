## Your Contributions
Any contributions you make will be licensed under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/lfroms/clouds/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers this project. When creating a new Swift source file, adjust the copyright in the header to match your name. Follow the same conventions as other source files already in the project.

## Basic Code Style
* 4 spaces for indentation in Swift, _no tabs_!
* Keep your lines short. If you need to scroll to see an entire line of code, it's time to break it up.
* Follow the documentation in the [Wiki](https://github.com/lfroms/clouds/wiki).

## How _Not_ to Contribute
* Don't contribute code that adds no significant value.
* If you don't add tests, the chances of your work getting merged drops from 100% to 10%. Write tests!
* If your code breaks something, or breaks any existing tests, it can't be merged unless you fix the issue.
